COSMOS 2018 @ UCDavis Final Project Data Organizer

In this project done in the summer of 2018, we created a probability map of knot transitions (defined by the number of crossings of a toplogical loop). Knots occur frequently during DNA recombination, and one aspect of recombination is the complexity of the knot, that might affect the nature of the recombination, leading to mutations and such. In our project, we simulated the probability of knot transitions from complexities up to 10 crossings and found that the most likely knot transition was to the unknot (a pure loop with no crossings) over many DNA recombinations. 

We find that the preferred mathematical and statistical state of any knot is of zero crossovers, suggesting that biologically, the hypothesis that there is a benefit to unknotting the DNA before recombination is supported statistically.
